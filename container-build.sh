# Dependency-aware Debian package builder for the exported statusbar trees.
#
# Usage: ./container-build.sh [<pkg> ...]
#   (no arguments)   build every package
#   <pkg> ...        build the named packages and their dependencies;
#                    names may be given as 'core' or 'statusbar-core'
#
# A package's .deb is rebuilt when its source tree is newer than the .deb,
# or when one of its dependencies was rebuilt during this run. Output is
# collected in deb-output/. Override the base image with DEBIAN_VERSION,
# the container engine with CONTAINER_ENGINE, and the target architecture
# with TARGET_PLATFORM (default linux/arm64; cross-arch needs qemu-user-static
# registered with the host kernel's binfmt_misc).
#
# STATUSBAR_TOOLCHAIN=clang|gcc selects the compiler (default clang). The gcc
# toolchain builds C++26 with g++-16 on a forky base and, by default, statically
# links the C++ runtime so the packages still install on an older target; its
# .deb files land in deb-output-gcc/ so the two toolchains never overwrite each
# other. Set STATUSBAR_STATIC_CXX=ON|OFF to override the static-runtime choice.
