# Dependency-aware cross-compile builder for the statusbar Debian packages.
# Native amd64 toolchain that cross-targets aarch64 via clang multi-target +
# Debian multiarch :arm64 dev libs — no qemu emulation. Produces arm64
# .debs much faster than the emulated path (./container-build.sh) but
# cannot run tests (binaries don't execute on the build host).
#
# Usage: ./container-build-cross.sh [<pkg> ...]
#   (no arguments)   build every package
#   <pkg> ...        build the named packages and their dependencies;
#                    names may be given as 'core' or 'statusbar-core'
#
# A package's .deb is rebuilt when its source tree is newer than the .deb,
# or when one of its dependencies was rebuilt during this run. Output is
# collected in deb-output/. Override the target arch with TARGET_ARCH and
# the container engine with CONTAINER_ENGINE.
#
# STATUSBAR_TOOLCHAIN=clang|gcc selects the compiler (default clang). clang
# cross-targets with its multi-target driver; gcc uses Debian's
# aarch64-linux-gnu cross compiler, which needs a forky-or-later base. As in
# the native path, gcc output goes to deb-output-gcc/ and statically links the
# C++ runtime by default (override with STATUSBAR_STATIC_CXX=ON|OFF).
