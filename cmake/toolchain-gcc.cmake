# Core toolchain: compiler selection, C++26, platform settings (GCC)
#
# Sibling of toolchain-clang.cmake, selectable per build directory. GCC 16 has
# more complete C++26 support than the clang the project is otherwise pinned to,
# so this toolchain defaults to -std=c++26 where the clang one defaults to
# c++23. Everything else mirrors the clang toolchain as closely as the two
# compilers allow; the deltas are called out inline.
#
# libstdc++ and libc++ objects cannot be mixed, so a GCC build must use its own
# build directory (the `gcc` CMake preset points at build-gcc/).

# Guard against CMake processing this toolchain file multiple times within a
# single configure pass (e.g. if a CMakeLists also include()s it after CMake
# itself already loaded it via --toolchain). Directory-scope, not CACHE — using
# a cache variable would suppress the toolchain (compiler/flags) on every
# *reconfigure*. Shares the variable name with toolchain-clang.cmake: exactly
# one of the two is ever loaded in a given build tree.
